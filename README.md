# RF5-global-metadata
Recreated from RF5's global-metadata.dat using [Il2CppDumper](https://github.com/Perfare/Il2CppDumper/)

Note:

- Files that were not in a namespace were placed in ``_no_namespace``.
- This repo only contains the function signature and object data. 
- Functions with generics have the opening and closing replaced with "--" due to lack of support for filenames with special characters.
